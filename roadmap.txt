next steps:
timer, with panic mode  (animation frames for smooth progress arc?; end of timer = got wrong; stop and reset timer ) (by april 22-23)
redeem chillicrabs & durians (50-50 logic, add 20 to timer) (by april 23-24)
anti cheating event listeners
some enter/keypress events to make my life easier

next next steps:
add 20+ more sample questions
change data to use options: ["first","second","third"] and correct: "correct answer", more flexibility question types

next next next steps:
beautify UI / pixel perfect tweaks / a landing page
quiz selection / quiz type (tourist vs local)
other question types (drag and drop, etc.)
randomly order answer options
start out with "warm up" questions (ease into the harder challenge)
use classes for quiz and question, and construct Quiz/Question with JSON data
hantu mode
"hot" streak mode (high UV?)
some answers which if selected are so very wrong that the quiz ends immediately
^ or the opposite: user clicks a wildly wrong answer & some fun bonus mode occurs
recycle missed questions mode (maybe, eg cant finish quiz until all questions correct)
turn into generic quiz builder... for any type of quiz.... replace 'durian' 'chillicrab' with generic constants
