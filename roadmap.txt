next steps:
bug: durian not clicakble in panic mode?? b/c frantic-bounce.... other issue: redeem during panic mode, should restore opacity
test out anti cheating event listeners
landing image circles: improve drift animation.... make them bounced around.... will have to use JS and css variables.... have to absolute position?
add instructions (landing page section?)
add 10 more local challenge questions
landing page design: Scrolling clouds (or not?), some landscape/map as background iamge? something not too distracting given all the img circles
bug check mark can go off screen or has unexpected gaps from top of question text.... character limits partially solves, investigate.....


next next steps:
fun hantu mode
somehow track/save high scores for when inevitbly lose locals challenge, so can keep trying to beat high scores.... 
easter eggs for certain wrong answers (like 'gorgonu' cuts your time in half for rest of quiz, 'gorgonu mode')
demo of another question type (fill in blank or.... drag and drop, etc., or play a song to identify it?)
panic mode heart beat sounds (maybe not)
start out with "warm up" questions (ease into the harder challenge); or restrict some questions from never appearing early?

next next next steps:
randomly order answer options
try again with JSON.... 
use classes for quiz and question, construct Quiz/Question with JSON data
recycle missed questions mode (maybe, eg cant finish quiz until all questions correct)
turn into generic quiz builder... for any type of quiz.... replace 'durian' 'chillicrab' with generic constants


maybe fix or add later?

make look OK on mobile
bug: handle submit button with no answer selection (or punish for not bothering to select anything?)
abcd keypress events to make my life easier [doesnt impact mobile....]
improve ‘Singapore’ scrolling name change: some flip/fade animation
maybe use empty heart container along with full ones
acknowledge item redemption (some flash notice?)
some css animation/transition for select quiz/start quiz
double the panic mode refresh rate like the old timer
