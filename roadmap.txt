next steps:
do something with scores/streaks [track previous scores/high score?.... "hot streak" after ^ more questions]
^ streak of 5+ for demo.... show the jungle fowl, animate.... 
add local challenge questions
some enter/keypress events to make my life easier
bug: handle submit button with no answer selection
improve panic mode: css transition/animation of question box so it starts bobbing; play panic mode heart beat sound 
some animation/transition when you select a quiz before the quiz starts
some instructions for how the quiz works
a progress arc animation for timer
anti cheating event listeners

next next steps:
fun hantu mode
easter eggs for certain wrong answers (like 'gorgonu' cuts your time in half for rest of quiz, 'gorgonu mode')
demo of another question type (fill in blank or.... drag and drop, etc., or play a song to identify it?)

next next next steps:
randomly order answer options
start out with "warm up" questions (ease into the harder challenge)
try again with JSON.... 
use classes for quiz and question, construct Quiz/Question with JSON data
recycle missed questions mode (maybe, eg cant finish quiz until all questions correct)
turn into generic quiz builder... for any type of quiz.... replace 'durian' 'chillicrab' with generic constants
