next steps:
bug where check mark goes partially off screen if text box is too big.... hmm
improve the landing image circles… make them bounce..... randomly cycle new ones in out? 
improve ‘Singapore’ scrolling name change: some flip/fade animation
add instructions (landing page section?)
acknowledge item redemption (some flash notice?)
some css animations for: when select quiz/start quiz
add a bunch of local challenge questions
abcd keypress events to make my life easier
bug: handle submit button with no answer selection
anti cheating event listeners
make look OK on mobile
maybe the empty heart container along with full ones
landing page design: Scrolling clouds (or not?), some landscape/map as background iamge? something not too distracting given all the img circles
improve junglefowl animations if time

next next steps:
fun hantu mode
somehow track/save high scores for when inevitbly lose locals challenge, so can keep trying to beat high scores.... 
easter eggs for certain wrong answers (like 'gorgonu' cuts your time in half for rest of quiz, 'gorgonu mode')
demo of another question type (fill in blank or.... drag and drop, etc., or play a song to identify it?)
panic mode heart beat sounds (maybe not)
start out with "warm up" questions (ease into the harder challenge); or restrict some questions from never appearing early?

next next next steps:
randomly order answer options
try again with JSON.... 
use classes for quiz and question, construct Quiz/Question with JSON data
recycle missed questions mode (maybe, eg cant finish quiz until all questions correct)
turn into generic quiz builder... for any type of quiz.... replace 'durian' 'chillicrab' with generic constants
