next steps:
assign surprises to questions, randomly
status bar render for durians, chillicrabs
dismissable notices for gained items/surprises
timer, with panic mode  (animation frames for smooth progress arc?; end of timer = got wrong; stop and reset timer )
redeem chillicrabs & durians (50-50 logic, add 20 to timer)

next next steps:
ui screens for winning/lsoing
use 'enter' events or keypress 1,2,3,4,a,b,c,d 
randomly order answer options
change data to use options: ["first","second","third"] and correct: "correct answer", more flexibility question types
add 20+ more sample questions
anti cheating event listeners

next next next steps:
quiz selection / quiz type (tourist vs local)
beautify UI / a landing page
other question types (drag and drop, etc.)
start out with "warm up" questions (ease into the harder challenge)
use classes for quiz and question, and construct Quiz/Question with JSON data
hantu mode
"hot" streak mode (high UV?)
some answers which if selected are so very wrong that quiz ends immediately
recycle missed questions mode (maybe)
turn into generic quiz builder... for any type of quiz.... replace 'durian' 'chillicrab' with generic constants
