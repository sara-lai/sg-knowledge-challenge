next steps:
landing page improve: cerulean/sky blue backdrop/gradient too (remove quiz start).... scroll down to green land/singapore with info box above it (instructions, about this app, etc.)
bug: if redeem multiple chillicrabs if just gives you the answer
landing image circles: possible improve?
landing page design: Scrolling clouds (or not?), some landscape/map as background iamge? something not too distracting given all the img circles

next next steps:
fun hantu mode
somehow track/save high scores for when inevitbly lose locals challenge, so can keep trying to beat high scores.... 
easter eggs for certain wrong answers (like 'gorgonu' cuts your time in half for rest of quiz, 'gorgonu mode')
demo of another question type (fill in blank or.... drag and drop, etc., or play a song to identify it?)
panic mode heart beat sounds (maybe not)
start out with "warm up" questions (ease into the harder challenge); or restrict some questions from never appearing early?

next next next steps:
randomly order answer options
try again with JSON.... 
use classes for quiz and question, construct Quiz/Question with JSON data
recycle missed questions mode (maybe, eg cant finish quiz until all questions correct)
turn into generic quiz builder... for any type of quiz.... replace 'durian' 'chillicrab' with generic constants


maybe fix or add later?
improve anti cheating event listeners (remove JS question data?)
make look OK on mobile - will img circles destroy perofrmance on mobile?
add instructions (landing page section?)
bug: handle submit button with no answer selection (or punish for not bothering to select anything?)
abcd keypress events to make my life easier [doesnt impact mobile....]
improve ‘Singapore’ scrolling name change: some flip/fade animation
maybe use empty heart container along with full ones
acknowledge item redemption (some flash notice?)
some css animation/transition for select quiz/start quiz
double the panic mode refresh rate like the old timer
maybe dont use ids in data, error prone.... create ids by looping instead?
