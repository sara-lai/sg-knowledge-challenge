next steps:
redeem chillicrabs / 50-50
handle submit button with no answer selection
reorganize data.js, then add a bunch more questions
do something with scores/streaks [track previous scores/high score?.... "hot streak" after ^ more questions]
anti cheating event listeners
some enter/keypress events to make my life easier

next next steps:
quiz selection / quiz type (tourist vs local) ; init the appropriate quiz
add animation to timer.... like the progress arc that surrounds the number
play panic mode heart beat sound
a landing page
fun hantu mode
easter eggs for certain wrong answers (like 'gorgonu' cuts your time in half for rest of quiz, 'gorgonu mode')

next next next steps:
demo of another question type (fill in blank or.... drag and drop, etc., or play a song to identify it?)
randomly order answer options
start out with "warm up" questions (ease into the harder challenge)
try again with JSON.... 
use classes for quiz and question, construct Quiz/Question with JSON data
recycle missed questions mode (maybe, eg cant finish quiz until all questions correct)
turn into generic quiz builder... for any type of quiz.... replace 'durian' 'chillicrab' with generic constants
