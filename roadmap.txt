next steps:
challengeName display stuff: update win/lose pages; link to locals challenge from tourist win page; update go home button to landing page
win page: share how many got wrong
lose page: share score 
animate the landing sg-related circles… give them random sizes, randomly cycle new ones in out  -> put on page from JS instead of hardcode
improve ‘Singapore’ scrolling name change: some flip/fade animation
Scrolling clouds (or not?)
improve junglefowl: stagger animations or change angles, not all coordinated
add instructions (landing page section?)
acknowledge item redemption (some flash notice?)
some css animations for: when select quiz/start quiz
add a bunch of local challenge questions
abcd keypress events to make my life easier
bug: handle submit button with no answer selection
anti cheating event listeners
make look OK on mobile

next next steps:
fun hantu mode
somehow track high scores for when inevitbly lose locals challenge?
easter eggs for certain wrong answers (like 'gorgonu' cuts your time in half for rest of quiz, 'gorgonu mode')
demo of another question type (fill in blank or.... drag and drop, etc., or play a song to identify it?)
panic mode heart beat sounds (maybe not)
start out with "warm up" questions (ease into the harder challenge); or restrict some questions from never appearing early?

next next next steps:
randomly order answer options
try again with JSON.... 
use classes for quiz and question, construct Quiz/Question with JSON data
recycle missed questions mode (maybe, eg cant finish quiz until all questions correct)
turn into generic quiz builder... for any type of quiz.... replace 'durian' 'chillicrab' with generic constants
